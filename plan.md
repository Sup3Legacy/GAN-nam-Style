- R-VAE for supervised genre detection
    - Input: raw spectrogram
    - Ouput: reconstructed sample (spectrogram)
    - Latent variable we hope to have: echonest's audiofeatures, genre, perhaps more
    - Also: can map genre to a audiofeature/latent variable distribution
- Using this network for style transfer by manipulating latent variables
